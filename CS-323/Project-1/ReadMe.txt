Project Description Given: The objective of this assignment is to write a lexer for the A2 programming language lexicon. The lexer transforms an A2 high-level program into a list of tokens for that program (in a special format). For
convenience, this lexer will take input from standard-input (stdin) and send output to standard-output (stdout).
Coding is in C++.
